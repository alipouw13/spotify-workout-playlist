## Development

- Frontend: React + Vite (`frontend/`)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (`backend/`)

### Running the App Locally (Development)

1. **(Optional) Create a Python virtual environment**
   
   If you plan to run Python scripts or tests (e.g., in the `tests/` folder), it's recommended to create a virtual environment in the project root:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate on Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   
   Open two terminals (or use tabs):
   
   In the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
   
   In the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**
   
   In the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the backend runs on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

4. **Start the frontend development server**
   
   In the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default, the frontend runs on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

5. **Open the app**
   
   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

> Make sure your `.env` file is set up in the `backend/` directory with your Spotify credentials.

## Customization

- Add your own screenshots to `frontend/src/assets/` for the README
- Tweak the playlist selection algorithm in `backend/mcpClient.js`
